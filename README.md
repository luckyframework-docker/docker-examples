# Docker Examples

This repository holds examples of how to use Docker with Lucky. There are a lot of ways to take advantage of containerizing your application in development, testing, CI/CD, and production. Which one(s) you use depends a lot on your app and your devops goals.

## Contributing

I would love to have the community contribute different setups they are using right now for hobby projects, large-scale production apps, and everything inbetween. Just drop a directory here with a useful name and a `README` explaining the example. If it's similar to an example that already exists, I'll encourage you to either join forces with the existing example or to provide some pros/cons/comparison.
